# wallpapers

These wallpapers are by no means mine, but I am too lazy to credit authors of each one of them.
(Actually they are mostly "borrowed" from [here](https://github.com/zDyanTB/aesthetic-wallpapers), [here](https://github.com/D3Ext/aesthetic-wallpapers) and [here](https://github.com/whoisYoges/lwalpapers).)
